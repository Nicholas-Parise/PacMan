# PacMan
A C++ SFML Pacman clone 

<p>This is the newest attempt at a pacman clone. I started this project in 2019 pre covid and remade it during the pandemic, but abandoned the project when I started university. So now I'm remaking it again and hopfully this time it's done right<p>

<p>I would like to thank 'Retro Game Mechanics Explained' for the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ataGotQ7ir8 This video gave the basis of the ghost pathfinding algorithm, ghost states, and many other unique features of Pacman</p>
